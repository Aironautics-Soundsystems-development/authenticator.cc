### Data Storage and Use

- Authenticator only collects data you provide, such as when you scan a QR code to add an account or change a setting.
- Authenticator stores all data locally using the storage services provided by your browser. Technical information on how Authenticator stores account data is available [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage).
- If you have signed into Edge your account data may be synced with your Microsoft account. You can disable this by either going to the `Storage & Backup` menu and changing the `Storage Location` setting to `local` or by disabling extension data sync in Edge. Consult the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement) for more information.
- If you login to any 3rd party service under the Storage & Backup menu Authenticator will begin to routinely upload your account data to that service. You can stop this by going to the Storage & Backup menu, clicking the name of the service you signed into, and clicking Logout. Consult the privacy policies of these services for information about how they handle your data.

### Managing Your Data

You can download a copy of your data using the `Export / Import` menu's `Download Backup` button. You can delete your data by pressing the pencil in the top-right corner and clicking the red minus next to the entry you want to delete or by uninstalling the extension. You can add a password to encrypt your data in the `Security` menu.
